UPDATE: NO LONGER MAINTAINED
now using pihole via my own wiregaurd vpn server with internet traffic routed through mullvad and dns queries going through DNSCrypt-proxy. 

# DNS-Blocklist
The domains on this list have been cobbled together from the list of blocked domains on AdGuard Home from my iPhone. It is intended to be lightweight and geared towards
on device dns filters for iOS Devices such as AdGuard for a balance between privacy and battery life. I will personally use this list when i'm not connected to
my home network. I will add domains as I discover them. I plan to update this list atleast once a week. I will also test this list often, however if you are experincing any issues drop me it in the issues section and I shall investigate.  

PLEASE NOTE: I will try not to include domains that are blocked by AdGuard's default DNS rules, as this list is intended for AdGuard DNS for iOS, there's little point in including them (other than using excess power).

contains some ad and tracking domains found in Apple's iOS, various mobile apps, and websites. This list will be ever expanding
Basically, whatever my AdGuard Home setup blocks from my iPhone, will be added to this list.
